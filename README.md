<h1 align="center">Broyhill Wind Turbine Kiosk </h1>

The Broyhill Wind Turbine Kiosk encapsulates and abstracts data collected primarily from sensors inside Appalachian State’s wind turbine. The project aims to provide a source of entertainment and enrichment of the mind curious to discover the benefits renewable energy sources have on economics and our ecosystem. To achieve this, programmed visual aids are dynamically displayed based on various inputs from the turbine and third-party sources. This includes a rotating turbine on screen showing a simulated representation of the physical state of the turbine, a wind direction and speed indicator, histogram plots that track the power generated over time, cost-savings estimate infographics, and models showing its impact on the electric grid. With these abstractions, users of the application will be better informed about the school’s renewable energy initiatives and drawn towards focusing their studies on the topic. A further objective for this project is to provide quicker readings from the sensors on the turbine. The data path needs significant repair in order to overcome the obstruction, as of now all data points are collected at 5 minute intervals. A more ideal solution would be to directly push the readings from the hardware registers in a 15 second stream to the database without an intermediary step.
